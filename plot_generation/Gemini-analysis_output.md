# Analysis
Okay, let's break down this data and the visualizations you've provided.

**I. Overall Data Summary**

Based on the initial CSV data provided, here's a quantitative summary:

*   **Number of Records:** 200
*   **Key Columns:** The dataset includes information about job submissions on a high-performance computing (HPC) system. Key columns include `UID` (User ID), `JobIDRaw`, `Group`, `Account`, `JobName`, `TimelimitRaw`, `Submit`, `Start`, `End`, `State`, `ExitCode`, and resource usage metrics.
*   **Time Frame:** All of the jobs are submitted on the same day, October 11, 2021.
*   **Job States:** The `State` column indicates the final status of each job. Common states include `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `NODE_FAIL`, and `TIMEOUT`.
*   **Resource Usage:** Columns like `SystemCPU`, `CPUTimeRAW`, `ElapsedRaw`, `ReqMem`, `ReqNodes`, `NCPUS`, `UserCPU`, and `TRESUsageInTot` provide information about the resources requested and consumed by each job.
*   **User Activity:** Some users (`mcmahon`, `kmcmahon`, `jlbeck`, and `jbaron`) appear to have submitted a higher number of jobs than others.

**Analysis of UID, Count, and State**

*   **Focus on User 58707 (mcmahon):** This user has submitted the highest number of jobs based on the number of Job ID's that match their UID. A large portion of their jobs end with the state "NODE\_FAIL" and were ran on the 'ven113\_hpl' partition
*   **User 63064 (kmcmahon):** This user has a smaller count of jobs submitted, but a large portion of the jobs that user has submitted "FAILED" with state "FAILED"
*   **User 58467 (users):** This user had a number of jobs that state that a required node was not available, or "ReqNodeNotAvail"

**II. Bar Chart Analysis (User ID vs. Job Count by State)**

1.  **Most Active Users:**
    *   As suggested previously, it is easily noticable that user "58707" has submitted the greatest number of jobs
    *   User "63064" also has a higher number of jobs, a significant portion ending in "FAILED"

2.  **State Distribution Patterns:**
    *   **User "58707" (mcmahon):** has a notably higher number of "NODE\_FAIL" jobs, indicating potential hardware or node-related issues affecting their jobs.
    *   **User "58467" (users):** has a high number of "FAILED" jobs due to required nodes not being available

3.  **Quantitative Calculations and Observations:**

    *   To quantify these observations, we would calculate the following for each user:
        *   Total Jobs Submitted:  The overall height of the bar.
        *   Success Rate: `(Number of COMPLETED jobs / Total Jobs Submitted) * 100%`
        *   Failure Rate: `(Number of FAILED jobs / Total Jobs Submitted) * 100%`
        *   "NODE\_FAIL" Rate: `(Number of NODE_FAIL jobs / Total Jobs Submitted) * 100%`
        *   "CANCELLED" Rate: `(Number of CANCELLED jobs / Total Jobs Submitted) * 100%`
        *   "TIMEOUT" Rate: `(Number of TIMEOUT jobs / Total Jobs Submitted) * 100%`
    *   For example (estimating from the description, assuming we can visually estimate proportions roughly):
        *   **User 58707:**
            *   Total Jobs Submitted: 64
            *   Completed: 15
            *   Failure Rate: (15/64) = 23.43%
            *   "NODE\_FAIL" Rate: (30/64) = 46.88%
            *   "CANCELLED" Rate: (10/64) = 15.63%
        *   **User 63064:**
            *   Total Jobs Submitted: 21
            *   Completed: 8
            *   Failure Rate: (6/21) = 28.57%
            *   "NODE\_FAIL" Rate: 0%
            *   "CANCELLED" Rate: (2/21) = 9.52%
        *   **User 58467:**
            *   Total Jobs Submitted: 25
            *   Completed: 4
            *   Failure Rate: (20/25) = 80%
            *   "NODE\_FAIL" Rate: 0%
            *   "CANCELLED" Rate: 0%

**III. Line Chart Analysis (Job ID vs. Wait Time)**

1.  **Wait Time Fluctuations:** The line plot shows how wait times fluctuate across a range of Job IDs. There are spikes and dips, suggesting variability in job scheduling and resource availability.

2.  **Wait Time Trends:**

    *   **Overall Range:** The Y-axis shows a range of wait times from approximately -1 to +55 seconds.

    *   **General Trend:** The plot indicates a mix of jobs with shorter and longer wait times. There do not seem to be points less than 0 seconds, so this plot seems consistent. There are, however a few outliers that drastically increase the wait time

3.  **Calculations and Observations:**

    *   Calculate descriptive statistics on the wait times to quantify the trend:
        *   Minimum Wait Time
        *   Maximum Wait Time
        *   Mean (Average) Wait Time
        *   Median Wait Time
        *   Standard Deviation of Wait Times

    *   **Identification of Outliers:**
        *   Define a threshold for identifying outliers (e.g., wait times that are more than 2 or 3 standard deviations from the mean).
        *   Examine the characteristics of jobs associated with outlier wait times.

*   **Example Calculation (Hypothetical):**
    *   Let's assume that after calculation:
        *   Average Wait Time = 5 seconds
        *   Standard Deviation = 10 seconds
    *   An outlier threshold of 2 standard deviations would be 25 seconds.  Jobs with wait times exceeding 25 seconds would be flagged for further investigation.

**Additional Considerations**

*   **Correlations:** Investigate correlations between resource requests (CPU, memory, nodes) and job wait times and completion status.
*   **Partition/QOS Analysis:** Analyze the distribution of jobs across different partitions and QOS settings, and how these factors influence job performance.
*   **Temporal Analysis:**  If you had data spanning a longer period, you could examine how job submission patterns, resource usage, and system performance change over time.
