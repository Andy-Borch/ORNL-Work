# Analysis
Okay, let's analyze these two charts related to job submissions and wait times, looking for patterns, relationships, and key statistics.

**Chart 1: Jobs Submitted per User**

This chart displays the number of jobs submitted by each user, broken down by job state (Failed, Completed, Cancelled, Node Fail, Timeout).

**Key Observations:**

*   **User Activity Variation:** There's significant variation in the number of jobs submitted by different users. Some users submit a large number of jobs, while others submit very few. User `58707` submitted significantly more jobs than any other user.
*   **Dominant States:** The "Completed" and "Failed" states are the most common across all users.
*   **User 58707 Anomaly:** This user stands out significantly. They submitted a very large number of jobs. The breakdown of their job states is also distinct, with a large proportion of jobs ending in "Node Fail" and a smaller number of "Timeout" and "Cancelled."
*   **Sparse Data for Many Users:** Several users (e.g., 14972, 17047, 7391) have very few submissions.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

*   **Total Job Submissions:** By visually estimating from the chart, the total number of jobs submitted across all users is roughly 185. This is a rough estimate.

*   **Job State Distribution (across all users - estimate):**

    *   Completed: ~ 90 (49%)
    *   Failed: ~ 47 (25%)
    *   Node Fail: ~ 31 (17%)
    *   Cancelled: ~ 12 (6%)
    *   Timeout: ~ 5 (3%)

*   **User 58707's Contribution:** Let's estimate the percentage of total jobs contributed by user 58707. They submitted approximately 103 jobs out of the total 185. That's about 55.6%.

*   **Median Jobs per User (rough):** With 7 users represented, and values ranging from low to high (heavily skewed by user 58707), the median number of jobs submitted is likely in the range of 11-15.

**Chart 2: Wait Time vs. JobID**

This chart plots the wait time (in seconds) for different jobs against their `JobIDRaw`, categorized by their final state.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Mostly Low Wait Times:** The vast majority of jobs exhibit very low wait times (close to zero).
*   **Outliers in Wait Time:** There are a few significant outliers with substantially higher wait times. Specifically, there are two data points with significant wait times, one in the "Failed" state and one in the "Completed" state.
*   **Failed Job with High Wait Time:** There's a clear spike in wait time for a "Failed" job (JobID around 3090).
*   **Limited Cancelled Jobs:** There appear to be only two data points for cancelled Jobs at all.
*   **Correlation Implications:** The concentration of data near zero suggests that wait time is generally efficient but that occasional system or resource contention issues lead to extreme delays.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

*   **Range of Wait Times:** Wait times range from approximately 0 to about 52 seconds.
*   **Average Wait Time (estimate):** Because of the heavy skew and the outliers, the average wait time would be misleading. However, we can say that *most* jobs have a wait time close to zero. It's difficult to estimate the average without the underlying data.
*   **Maximum Wait Time:** The maximum wait time observed is approximately 52 seconds (for a "Failed" job).
*   **Frequency of Significant Wait Times:** Let's define "significant" as greater than 5 seconds. Visually, there appears to be only 2-3 jobs with wait times above this threshold. This is a very small fraction of all jobs.

**Relationships Between the Charts**

*   **User 58707 and Wait Times:** It would be useful to cross-reference User 58707's JobIDs with the wait time chart. Are the jobs from user 58707 particularly affected by high wait times? This could indicate a specific issue with their job submissions or with the resources they are requesting. This would require having the underlying data, as we can't directly link user IDs to JobIDs from the provided charts.
*   **State and Wait Time:** We can observe some correlation between job state and wait time. The "Failed" state seems to be associated with the highest wait time outlier. This could indicate that jobs that eventually fail experience some initial delays before terminating.

**Further Investigation**

To gain a more complete understanding, I would recommend the following:

1.  **Obtain the Raw Data:** The charts provide visual summaries, but accessing the raw data is essential for precise statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate the correlation coefficient between wait time and different job states. Perform feature engineering to encode the user ID as a categorical variable and assess if there's a correlation between the user ID and wait time.
3.  **Root Cause Analysis:** For the jobs with significant wait times, perform a root cause analysis to understand the underlying reasons for the delays (e.g., resource contention, system issues, code errors).
4.  **Time Series Analysis:** If the data includes timestamps, perform time series analysis to identify trends and seasonality in job submissions and wait times.
5.  **Cluster Analysis:** Cluster jobs based on their characteristics (user ID, job state, wait time, etc.) to identify distinct groups of jobs with similar behavior.
6. Investigate why user 58707 is submitting the type and quantity of jobs they are.

In summary, the analysis reveals that while most jobs have low wait times, there are some key outliers. User 58707 submits a significantly higher number of jobs than any other user. Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of the high wait times and to identify potential issues with User 58707's jobs.
